/*

Believe it or not, this is enough to launch an application! 

A Spring Boot application is, at a minimum, a public static void main entry-point and the @SpringBootApplication annotation. 
This tells Spring Boot to help out, wherever possible.

@SpringBootApplication is a meta-annotation that pulls in component scanning, autoconfiguration, and property support. 
We wonâ€™t dive into the details of Spring Boot in this tutorial, but in essence, it will fire up a servlet container and serve up our service.
